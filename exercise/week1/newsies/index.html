                <h2>man charged with robbery</h2>
                <p>Man walked into a Chase Bank on 134 St. Jamestown with a toy gun sprayed with spray paint and demaned the teller to give 
                him 5,000 in cash or he was going to shoot someone. He was dressed in a suit and wearing sunglasses. He apparently 
                was trying to emulate the characters off of <span="movie">resevior dogs</span> a 1992 film directed by Quentin Tarantino. The teller pressed 
                the button for the police to come and within minutes he got arrested without force. He was charged with Attempted armed robbery,
                intimidation, conversion, and a whole string of charges. He is being held in Lake county jail with a bond of $300,000.

                <p>HAMMOND â€” A 27-year-old man smiled at a woman he was stalking and displayed a weapon 
                just hours before shooting up the home where she was sleeping earlier this month, according to court documents. 
                John Jordan Hennington Jr., of Hammond, faces one count of felony intimidation and five counts of criminal recklessness in connection with the April 1 incident, 
                according to a probable cause affidavit filed in Lake Criminal Court this week.
